<p>1._ Grammar is the system of a language. 
    People sometimes describe grammar as the "rules" of a language; 
    but in fact no language has rules*. If we use the word "rules", 
    we suggest that somebody created the rules first and then spoke 
    the language, like a new game. But languages did not start like 
    that.</p>

    <p>What is happening?</p>

    <p>2._ Languages started by people making sounds which evolved into 
        words, phrases and sentences. No commonly-spoken language is 
        fixed. All languages change over time. What we call "grammar" 
        is simply a reflection of a language at a particular time.</p>

        <P>3._ Do we need to study grammar to learn a language? The short 
            answer is "no". Very many people in the world speak their 
            own, native language without having studied its grammar.</P>
